### Open for work:
I am currently looking for a position as: **Fullstack-** or **Frontend-Web Developer**
### About Me

Originally from Berlin, Germany, I moved to France in 2005 to work at Blizzard Entertainment as a Customer Support Representative. I spent 16 years working for the company, until they closed the office in France in 2021.

When the office closed, I was given the opportunity to spend time to pursue further education and career development.

Eager to expand my horizons, I took advantage of the situation and started to learn immediately, first with some free online resources, such as [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/), followed by completing a Higher Education Certificate in Software Engineering at a German long distance college, the [Wilhelm Buechner Hochschule](https://www.wb-fernstudium.de/kursseite/professional-software-engineering.html). Subsequently, I dedicated my efforts to specialized training in web development through an intensive Web Development Bootcamp at [Ironhack](https://www.ironhack.com/).
